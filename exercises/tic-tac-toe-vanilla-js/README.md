# Tic Tac Toe

## Goal

Build a tic tac toe game in HTML and pure JavaScript

## Minimum Requirements

 - A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move;
 - Every click will alternate between marking an **X** and **O**;
 - A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked;
 - Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
 
## Getting Started

 - Take a look in [index.html](./index.html), field is already created. Add your necessary HTML tags, including script and link tags to link to your JavaScript and CSS respectively.
 - Try constructing the field programmatically with the mock data. The field page should include the 3x3 grid, and at minimum a reset button.

## Bonus

 - Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played;
 - After the necessary moves have been played, stop game and alert the winner if one player ends up winning with three in a row.
    - Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move.
